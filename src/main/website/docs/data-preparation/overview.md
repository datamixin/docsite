# Overview
This section describes how to perform data preparation with Datawork.

Data preparation is an important and often time-consuming step in data analysis and machine learning workflows. It involves cleaning, transforming and organizing raw data into a format suitable for analysis or modeling. Proper data preparation is critical to ensure that the data used for analysis or machine learning models is accurate, reliable and meaningful.

Previously we had been explained about [**Dataset**](/docs/dataset/overview) . after we have dataset we can do some data preparation in our dataset and will be explain in the next section.
